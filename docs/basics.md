# Main resources
- [MDN Web Docs by Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/) - the most valuable resource about web development
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - answers for all your questions
- [Features support by Can I use](https://caniuse.com/) - enter feature, use if everything is green. Or, for JS 
features, use Babel transpiler and polyfills ([polifyll.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/))
- [Browsers statistic](https://caniuse.com/usage-table) - please, support browsers with more than 0.5% market share and 
don't support IE 10 and below without important reasons (drop support for IE 11 too as it will be possible)
